## Problem 2: Panoramic Image Stitching

### Execution Details

- Running Problem 2's code will also require some time to display the outputs due to the complexity of image stitching operations.
- The first output will showcase the stitched panoramic image created by combining image 1 and image 2.
- The second output will display the panoramic image resulting from stitching image 4 back to image 1.

Please be patient after the first output is displayed, as the program will take some additional time to generate the second output.

### User Interaction

- For both codes related to Problem 1 and Problem 2, any opened window with the output can be closed by pressing the 'Q' key on your keyboard.

### Additional Information

- There is no need to install any non-standard libraries beyond those listed in the "Libraries Required" section for Problem 1.
- Ensure that all file paths are correct and correspond to the location of the images on your system.
